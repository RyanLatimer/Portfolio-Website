            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Open source software and contributions that I have made to have completely changed the way I view the world
                and the way I think about my life. It has brought upon me perspective into a world freed from corporate greed
                in which everyone comes together to build a better world, to create something beautiful for everyone regardless
                of who they are. Open source has changed the way I think about the world, my position in it, and what the future
                holds.

            <h2>Benefits of Open Source</h2>
            <p>Open Source brings to the table many benefits particularly in the software scene. It provides a way to decentralize
                products, ideas, and services from a corporation whose first objective is to make money. When the creators of
                something are less concerned about making money and more concerned about making something great, the product
                becomes much better and can achieve much more. Open source software sees massive benefits from the fact that
                anyone can contribute to the project. Development of major milestones occurs many times fast than with normal
                proprietary software. This is because the community can come together to solve problems and create new features.
                Bug fixing and identification of niche ideas are far faster and much more affected as many of the developers are
                users and want to build the best possible product for themselves to use and for anyone else to use. Open source
                software is a way to develop more relevant software faster and inclusively while keeping it free and available for
                everyone.
