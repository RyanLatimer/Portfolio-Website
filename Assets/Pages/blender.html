            <h2>Getting Started with Blender</h2>
            <p>I began working with blender when I was ten years old. I made it through the inaugural donut tutorial,
                but as a result of my age did not continue with the software. I recently got back into the software and
                have relearned the basics and am continuing to learn more advanced techniques and make more complex
                renders.

            <h2>First Projects</h2>
            <p>After I completed the donut tutorial (for the second time) I worked on building a scene to represent a logo.
                I took an artistic and painted logo, and built a 3D photorealistic scene to represent it. The camera would
                then pull back, revealing that the scene was a part of the logo.

            <h2>Going Forward</h2>
            <p>As I progressed, I moved into more complex projects and renders including space scenes, building assets
                for games, and future projects. I have also begun more complex renders that involve simulated physics of
                rigid bodies and water. I have really enjoyed the creative aspect of Blender and will enjoy continuing to
                work with it.
